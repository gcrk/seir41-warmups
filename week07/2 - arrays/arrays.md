## Arrays - Flatten and Reverse

The goal of this exercise is to manipulate arrays by creating a function that can reverse an array and by creating a function that can flatten an array. Do not use any libraries to complete this task - write this stuff from scratch using standard JS methods and objects.

- Make two functions
  - reverse
  - flatten

```js
reverse( [1, 2, 3, 4] );
// => [ 4, 3, 2, 1 ]
flatten( ["Hello", ["World", 42] ] );
// => [ "Hello", "World", 42 ]
```

You only need to make flatten work to one level deep! You should be able to flatten this - ` ["Hello", ["World"]] ` - but not this - ` ["Hello", [[["World"]]]] `

## Bonus

Make one that flattens any array that you pass into it: ` ["Hello", [[["World"], 42]]] ` -> `[ "Hello", "World", 42 ]`
