## Recurring Letters

Create a function that takes in a sentence and outputs the letter thatâ€™s repeated most frequently.

```js
recurringLetter('just a simple sentence chilling');
// => The recurring letter of "just a simple sentence chilling" is e
capitaliseLetter('just a simple sentence chilling', 'e');
// => just a simplE sEntEncE chilling
```

Use simple sentences with regular spaces between each word (like in the sentence you are reading) but if you want you can account for other characters such as !@#$%^&*? etc..

*Hint:* You'll need to loop and count each of the letters.

**Bonus:** Create another function that capitalises that letter within the sentence.
