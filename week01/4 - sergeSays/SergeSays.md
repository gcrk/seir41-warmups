# Warmup - Serge Says

Create a function so Serge can respond!

## Examples

- Serge answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question.

- He answers 'Woah, chill out!' if you yell at him (ALL CAPS).

- He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying anything.

- He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.

- Create a function that takes an input and returns Serge's response.
