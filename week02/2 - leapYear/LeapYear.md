# Leap Year Warmup Exercise

Write a function that will take any given year and return whether it is a leap year or not. Remember that a leap year is:

Every year that is evenly divisible by 4
Except if it is evenly divisible by 100...
Unless it is also divisible by 400

Test Data... Make sure it is working!

- 1997 is not a leap year, it should return false
- 1996 is a leap year, it should return true
- 1900 is not a leap year, it should return false
- 2000 is a leap year, it should return true

How to structure it...

- We want a custom function called isLeapYear, that takes one parameter which is year, and outputs either true or false

Bonus!

- Ask the user what number they want to test

console.log(isLeapYear(1997));
console.log(isLeapYear(1996));
console.log(isLeapYear(1900));
console.log(isLeapYear(2000));
