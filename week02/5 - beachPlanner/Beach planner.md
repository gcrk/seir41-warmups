# Beach Planner

Write a program that, given a minimum temperature and a maximum rainfall forecast, output a list of day you can go to the beach.

## example:

with the following forecast:
```javascript
monday: the temperature is 20 and there is 12mm of rain
tuesday: the temperature is 25 and there is 6mm of rain
wednesday: the temperature is 27 and there is 24mm of rain
thursday: the temperature is 32 and there is 65mm of rain
friday: the temperature is 18 and there is 2mm of rain
saturday: the temperature is 26 and there is 0mm of rain
sunday: the temperature is 27 and there is 14mm of rain
```

If i'm ok to go to the beach with a temperature at least 24 degrees and no more than 8mm of rain, the output of the program
should be : Tuesday and Saturday
