# Anagram Detector

Write a program that, given a word and a list of possible anagrams, selects the anagrams of the given word. A word is an anagram if its letters can be rearranged to create a new word.

In other words, given: `"listen"` and `["enlists" "google" "inlets" "banana"]` the program should return "inlets".
