# Robot Factory 🤖

You run a robot factory. As robots are created, they roll off the conveyor belt as empty, mindless husks of machinery -- until you first boot them up.

The first time you boot them up, a random name is randomly generated, and assigned to itself by the robot.

Names typically take the format of things like "BX777" or "SD234".

For instance:
```rb
robot1 = Robot.new

puts robot1.name
=> "BX777"

robot2 = Robot.new

puts robot2.name
=> "SD234"

puts robot2.name
=> "SD234"
```

Every once in a while we need to reset a robot to its factory settings, which means that their name gets wiped. The next time you ask, it gives a new name.

if I say:
```rb
robot3 = Robot.new

puts robot3.name
=> "RF629"

robot3.reset

puts robot3.name
=> "ZC532"
```

### Counters 🔢
It's important that we not overwork our robots. While resetting to factory defaults is great, the wear and tear on the robot mechanisms doesn't go away.

For every action our robot takes, we should keep track of it.

```rb
robot3 = Robot.new
puts robot3.name
puts robot3.name

robot3.reset
puts robot3.name
puts robot3.name

puts robot3.instruction_count
=> 5
```

### Robot Time ⌚️
Number of instructions is important, but so is the total age of the robot.
```rb
robot3 = Robot.new
puts robot3.timers
=> "21 seconds since last boot, 21 seconds since creation"

robot3.reset
puts robot3.timers
=> "8 seconds since last boot, 29 seconds since creation"
```
